# Time N*3^L where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word to be matched. 

# For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from).
# As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding direction. Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L.
# We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be NNN times invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case.
